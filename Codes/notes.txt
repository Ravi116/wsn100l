/*/*/*		Programming_Principles and Practice using c++	*/*/*/





when programming is done well,such concerns minimize the need for the most frustrating part of 
programming:debugging; that is,good program structure during developement can minimize yhe 
numbers of mistakse made and the time needed to search for such errors and to remove them.


Tool for organizing program:-(break up a big computation into many liitle ones.)

(1)Abstraction:-Hide details taht we dont need to use a facility(Implementation details)
		behind a convenient and general interface.
Ex.Rather than considering the details of how to sort a phone book,we just call the sort 
   algorithm from standard c++ library.(for details read book ch(4.2))

(2)Divide and conquer:-take a large problem and divide it into several little ones.

Emphasis(special importance) on structure and organization:you dont get good code just by 
writing lots of statements.

If you have the ambition to build something resonably permanent,you pay attentionto matters
of code structure and organizationalong the way, rather than having to come back and learn 
them after failures.
